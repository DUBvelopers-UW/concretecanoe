      <p class = "GoldBody">Here at Concrete Canoe, we build a canoe entirely out of concrete! That sounds like a tall task,
        but we're a group of determined students who love problem solving, teamwork, and working towards
        a project bigger than ourselves! Joining our team will give you experience in engineering, communication,
        and teamwork that is vital for any internship or professional career. There is no application process and
        we are open to students from all backgrounds.</p>
