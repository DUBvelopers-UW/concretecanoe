        Concrete Canoe always needs more people to help out and the Outreach team's
        goal is to find these people. Whether they be new students, past alumni, or potential
        sponsors, the Outreach team reaches out to everyone through hosting events, sending emails,
        or giving presentations. There's much more to engineering than technical skills, and an
        outreach team is a great opportunity to develop these other important personal skills.
        We are also working on managing the team website and social media accounts to help Outreach
        for Concrete Canoe.

        Racing is what most people think of when they think about the concrete canoe competition.
        However, this is only around 20% of the final score, which makes sense after all. This is
        an engineering competition, not a who has the swolest paddlers competition.

        Our Competition team is in charge of making sure the quality of all the aspects of our
        final products are the best they can ever be. The project proposal is where the actual
        design of the canoe is evaluated and compiles the various design in one massive document.
        The competition subteam is a great way to improve your technical writing skills and have
        a direct impact in the success of our team.

      <p class = "finance-block-text">
        Making a concrete canoe is surprisingly expensive. Materials, transportation, and 
        miscellaneous costs add up quickly with last year’s total being around $30,000. 
        The finance team keeps track of money being spent and money coming in with sponsors. 
        Economics is a very important part of engineering in general so the Finance team is the 
        place to go if you want to learn more.
