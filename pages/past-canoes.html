        <p>Due to COVID-19, this year's competition was conducted entirely online! Despite not being able to physically build a canoe, our team focused our efforts on designing and modeling one virtually. After many Zoom calls, documentation, and remote work, we took first place in the ASCE Pacific-Northwest Student Conference and third place in nationals.

        <h2 class="title">INCALMO</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, this year’s activites were cut short by the outbreak of COVID-19. As such, regional and national competitions were canceled, and the Incalmo canoe wasn’t fully constructed. Nevertheless, we’re still proud of the work that our members did this year, as it paved the way towards improving our methods for future competitions!<p>

        <h2 class="title">SKYBEAM</h2>
        <p>Placed 1st at Regionals and 3rd at Nationals.<br>
          <br>
          The Skybeam canoe featured interior inlays representing the spotlights that shoot out of the top of the Space Needle for special events. It also had a Space Needle logo on the front of the canoe, with Science Center arches on the back.
          This canoe vastly improved upon past designs, and was much thinner (36%) and used concrete that was stronger (22% in compressive strength) than the previous year’s canoe.
