        Without our paddlers, our canoe wouldn't be able to move let alone win our competitions. That's why our
        paddlers constatntly train to be in the best shape possible for the competition and come up with new techniques
        and ideas to have an edge. If you're not that hardcore, that's alright though! You can still show up
        to workouts in order to get in better shape and just have fun in the water

        The canoe has to be created by hand which can take many hours of work. The construction
        team aims to streamline this process as well as physically build the canoe. Placing the
        concrete, sanding, and patching are all tasks that anyone can help out with and is a
        great way to meet new friends.

        Although our canoe is designed for competition and performance, it also needs to look
        good too. That's where aesthetics comes in. Aesthetics comes up with a theme for the
        canoe and all the visuals associated with it including the technical proposal,
        presentations, decorations, and the actual canoe itself. If you want to take a break
        from engineering and be creative, aesthetics is the place to join.
